    <!The why I chose AWF section>
<div id="Why">
    <h2>Why do I want to help this charity?</h2>
        <p>I chose to help the African Wildlife Foundation because I really like animals and I think that all animals from endangerd to rare they should be protected. The reason that I chose to go with a charity in africa is because of the state of Africa. When I was learning about Africa in school we were learning how failed and corrupt of a Continent it is. So I chose to turn to the light side and focus on the good in africa, and help out the continent by rasing money for the endangerd animals and lands. So now you know whu I chose the African Wildife Foundation.</p>
